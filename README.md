# USA TODAY API Client Library for PHP
###PHP client libraries created with Mashery I/O Wraps, a semi-automated native language SDK generator.

## What is the Rovi Cloud Services API?
Rovi is a global leader in digital entertainment technology for some of the largest CE manufacturers, service providers and online, mobile and application developers in the world. We now have a range of APIs that can help you to create and deliver an even more enhanced entertainment experience to your customers.

Head over to [developer.rovicorp.com](http://developer.rovicorp.com) to learn more. You can register for instant access to their API, view their documentation, and even make live API calls with their interactive docs.

## Summary
An API client library (also known as an SDK or language wrapper) is an efficiency tool for programmer that helps bind external resources to your native programming language. Traditionally, to integrate an API into your project without a client library, you would need to do the following:

1. Construct a network request using a transport library (e.g. HTTP)

2. Integrate authentication flow and signatures (e.g. OAuth, MD5/SHA-256, etc.)

3. Construct and execute API calls manually, often a trial and error process while reading documentation

4. Parse through results

5. Lather. Rinse. Repeat.

## How does the client library help?
Client libraries make life easier by bringing the API into your native language environment. So, rather than making curl calls, piping the output into a variable, and parsing through the variable -- the client library handles the network connectivity, authorization and API call execution with syntax you're familiar with:

    // Initialize the client library
    $client = new apiClient();

    // Set your API key
    $client->setDeveloperKey("YOUR_KEY_HERE");
    $client->setDeveloperSecret("YOUR_SECRET_HERE");

    // Connect client to the API
    $api = new apiService($client);

    // Make an API call and store the response in a variable/object
    $responseObj = $api -> AutocompleteMethods -> Autocomplete ("lady");

Above is just a pseudo-PHP-code example of how this library works. If you'd like to see it in action, check out the example PHP files in this repo.

## Requirements
1. PHP - if you'd like a quick a dirty isolated LAMP stack, check out [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html). Works on Mac, PC and even Linux.
2. USA TODAY API key -- head over to [http://developer.rovicorp.com](http://developer.rovicorp.com) 

## IDE is optional, but nice
At Mashery, we love [vim](http://www.vim.org) just as much as the next guy, but when it comes to tool-tips, code-completion and general object-oriented goodness, IDEs can be really useful. [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org), [Aptana](http://aptana.com), [Netbeans](http://netbeans.org), [Komodo](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide), etc. They're all very mature and useful tools.

## Installation / Quick Start Guide
Follow the steps below for a quick start to using this client library:

1. Grab the latest source with git. 

    <pre>git clone git://github.com/mashery/io-wrap-usatoday-php.git</pre>

2. Move the project source tree into your sandbox LAMP stack environment (anywhere below the httpdocs/htdocs level -- example code is relatively linked)

3. Head over to [Rovi Cloud Services](http://developer.rovicorp.com) to fetch an API key

4. Open up your editor and add your API key where you see *YOUR_KEY_HERE* on the sample PHP scripts.

5. Point your browser to one of the example files where this is deployed:

    <pre>Ex: http://localhost/io-wrap-rovi-php/rovi_autocopmlete.php</pre>
