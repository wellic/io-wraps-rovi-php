=================
v0.5 - PHP wrapper for Rovi Cloud Service APIs

Unpack this package into a directory at the "htdocs" level on any web server stack with PHP. The references to the dependences are
all relative.

1. The three functional PHP examples are rovi_autocomplete.php, rovi_metadata.php and rovi_tvlistings.php. These are live examples, not the libraires. To see how the libraries are used, just peek at the source.

2. Add your keys and secrets to these source files to make calls. Each API requires a unique key/secret. Head over to http://developer.rovicorp.com, sign in, and navigate to "My Account" to fetch or register for keys.

3. Navigate your browser to the example PHP apps, and give it a whirl.

Requirements: Any standard LAMP stack. PHP requirements are the regular suspects. Please report any dependency issues along with a stack bio (OS, server, etc.).
